# 🧩 Extending Atom

Atom is opinionated but not closed. You extend it **without editing core files**, so you can pull framework updates (via `sync.py`) at any time without losing your work.

## The Golden Rule

Core files — `main.py`, upstream Atom files in `function/`, `config.py`, and the shipped routers — are **overwritten by `sync.py`** on update. Put custom logic in uniquely named function modules or the drop-in extension files:

| Your file | Purpose | Survives `sync.py`? |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| `config_extend.py` | Override / add any config value | ✅ yes |
| `function/custom_<your>.py` | Add functions with unique names | ✅ yes, if the path is absent from upstream Atom |
| `router/<your>.py` | Add new API endpoints | ✅ yes, unless it is one of the six synced core routers |
| `.env` | Secrets & connection strings | ✅ yes |

Configuration extensions are loaded after the defaults in `main.py`:

```python
config_modules = [config] + ([importlib.import_module("config_extend")] if importlib.util.find_spec("config_extend") else [])
config_values = {key: value for module in config_modules for key, value in vars(module).items() if key.startswith("config_")}
```

`config_extend.py` is read after `config.py`, so its `config_*` values override the defaults. Only `config_*` names are taken from it: functions defined there are ignored, so they cannot replace core functions. It is kept out of the sync list. Custom function files are discovered by the `function` package.

## Complete flow: config → router → function

For a custom endpoint, create these three files in order. This example adds `GET /custom/hello`, which returns a greeting. Finish all three steps before restarting Atom.

## 1. Add `config_extend.py`

Create this optional file in the project root. Merge the default route configuration so existing endpoints keep their policies:

```python
# config_extend.py
from config import config_api as base_config_api

config_custom_greeting = "Hello"
config_api = {
    **base_config_api,
    "/custom/hello": {"id": 200, "is_token": False},
}
```

Choose an unused API ID. The `config_api` entry defines the endpoint's auth, roles, rate limits, and caching; it does not create the endpoint. This example is public. Set `is_token` to `True` for a route that requires a token, and configure role checks as needed. A route without a policy entry defaults to no token requirement.

Only `config_*` names from this file are loaded. They override defaults from `config.py` and are available through `request.app.state`. Use `.env` for secrets and connection strings; see the [configuration guide](config.md).

## 2. Add the router file

Create a uniquely named Python file directly in `router/`, with a module-level `router = APIRouter()`:

```python
# router/custom_greeting.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/custom/hello")
async def func_api_custom_hello(*, request: Request):
    app_state = request.app.state
    name = request.query_params.get("name", "World")
    message = await app_state.func_custom_greeting(
        name=name,
        greeting=app_state.config_custom_greeting,
    )
    return {"status": 1, "message": message}
```

Use the same path in the router and `config_api`. Keep request handling in the router and business logic in `function/`. Atom discovers router files automatically; no edits to `main.py` are needed. Files beginning with `_` or `.` are skipped. Custom routers load alphabetically after the built-in tiers defined by `router_order` in `main.py`.

## 3. Add the function file

Create a uniquely named Python file directly in `function/`:

```python
# function/custom_greeting.py
async def func_custom_greeting(*, name: str, greeting: str):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"
```

Atom automatically exports functions defined in these modules whose names start with `func_`, then registers them on `app.state`. The router calls `request.app.state.func_custom_greeting`; no edits to `function/__init__.py` are needed.

The loader imports modules alphabetically. Files beginning with `_` and nested packages are not auto-loaded. Imported helpers are not exported a second time. Duplicate function names defined in different modules stop startup with an error naming both files, so use unique `func_*` names.

Inside a function module, import shared helpers from their defining module (for example, `from .request import func_query_bool_parse`), rather than from `function`, whose exports are still being assembled during loading. Keep module dependencies acyclic.

### Restart and verify

Restart Atom after creating the three files:

```bash
venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Call the endpoint:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/custom/hello?name=Atom"
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status": 1, "message": "Hello, Atom!"}
```

At runtime, Atom loads configuration and functions onto `app.state`, mounts the router, applies the route policy to the request, and runs the router handler. The handler reads the request, calls the business function, and returns the response. You can also inspect the endpoint in the API console at `/`.

Use distinctive filenames: sync replaces selected upstream function files and the six core routers (`index.py`, `auth.py`, `my.py`, `public.py`, `private.py`, `admin.py`), while preserving custom router files and developer-only function files. See the [sync guide](sync.md) for update behavior and recovery.

## 4. Add or change database tables

Tables are declared as data in `config.py` under `config_postgres["table"]` and created automatically on startup when `config_is_postgres_schema_init = True`. To add your own table without editing `config.py`, extend the structure in `config_extend.py`:

```python
# config_extend.py
from config import config_postgres

config_postgres["table"]["product"] = [
    {"name": "id", "datatype": "bigint", "identity": "always", "is_primary": True},
    {"name": "created_at", "datatype": "timestamptz", "default": "now()", "index": "btree(created_at)"},
    {"name": "created_by_id", "datatype": "bigint"},
    {"name": "title", "datatype": "text", "is_mandatory": True, "index": "gin_trgm(title)"},
    {"name": "price", "datatype": "numeric(10,2)"},
]
```

Column specs support `is_primary`, `is_mandatory`, `default`, `unique`, `check`, `regex`, `index` (btree / gin / gist / gin_trgm), array types, PostGIS geography, and `old` (for renames). Once a table has a `created_by_id` column it works with the generic `object-create` / `object-read` ownership flow out of the box.

## 5. Add background workers

New standalone processes go in `script/` and are run as separate processes (they're not part of the API). Use them for queue consumers or batch jobs; they read the same `config.py` and can import from `function`.

## Summary

| Goal | Do this |
|------|---------|
| Change a setting | Set it in `config_extend.py` |
| Add functions | New `function/custom_<your>.py` with unique `func_*` names |
| Add an endpoint | New file in `router/` + entry in `config_api` |
| Add a table | Extend `config_postgres["table"]` in `config_extend.py` |
| Add a worker | New script in `script/` |
| Enable a service | Set its `config_*_url` / key (in `.env` or `config_extend.py`) |
| Update Atom | See the separate [sync guide](sync.md) |

# about
```
1. an open-source backend framework for faster development
2. entire codebase is in a single file, main.py
3. combines procedural and functional programming
4. procedures ensures better global/local state access
5. functions ensures deterministic behavior of the code
6. follows SOLID principles wherever possible
7. supports high-performance application development
8. built with Python,FastAPI,PostgreSQL,Redis,Kafka,Rabbitmq,Mongodb
9. uses realtional dataabse at its core
10. uses raw SQL for better control
11. high-throughput pipelines via RabbitMQ, LavinMQ, or Kafka
12. object-level CRUD by directly interacting with database schema
13. auto-generates entire business database schemas from a single JSON config
14. ex. build a linkedIn-like backend in 2-3 weeks
```

# modules
```
1. auth module
2. endpoints with rbac using object approach
3. s3,ses,sns integration
4. deploy instantly using render
5. csv uploader
6. redis caching
7. kafka, rabbitmq, lavinmq, redis pub-sub integration
8. rate-limiter
9. database schema generator
10. background tasks  
11. read database replication  
12. mongodb as a secondary database
13. soft/hard delete on object level
```
